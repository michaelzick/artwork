# Saatchi Art Code Challenge

Ok, here it is!

When doing the bonus task, I worked hard to employ best-practices like keeping the reducer pure.
I didn't find the loading gif shown in the example so I pulled one off the net, created with CSS.

Of course run `$ yarn && yarn start` to get it going.

I hope it's good! :)
